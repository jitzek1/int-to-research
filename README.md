## Research Question and Hypotheses

**Research Question:**
How does the formality of greetings vary across the age group 18-25 and 65+ in digital communication?

**Hypotheses:**
I anticipate significant differences in formality of greetings among individuals from these distinct age groups in digital communication.
I think the age group 18-26 be less formal than the 65+. 

## Method
I want to use a Twitter n-gram. I will use the word "yo" for the age group 18-25 because I believe it's a word that is more commonly used by that group. For the older age group, I want to use the word "good" (morning/afternoon/night) because I think that's a word more commonly used by the 65+ group.
